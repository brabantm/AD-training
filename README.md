High-level usage example. To be improved.

#Create System, MLE and User
system = System(problem_parameters)
mlengine = MLE(params, problem_parameters, keys)
alice = User(params, problem_parameters, keys, latent_vector, preference)

#Create first weight v^0
v = system.newQuestion(dimension)

#Online Protocol B
while(not stop):
  grad = alice.GD(v)
  v = mlengine.GD(grad)
```
